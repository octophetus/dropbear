# Drop Bear

Use A and D to control which direction mama bear faces, use your mouse to
control where she walks in order to save the falling baby bears. Mouse over jam
and honey with mama bear's mouth for extra points. If animal control arrives,
make sure to attack him before he steals your baby bear!

Made with Scratch for the Harvard CS50 Week 0 problem set.
